Generate search queries for evidence retrieval.
Return ONLY a JSON object with keys: primary, secondary, tertiary, counter.
Each value is a list of short search queries (3-8 words).

Guidance:
- Primary = macro structural (policy, macroeconomy, geopolitics, demographics).
- Secondary = industry/ecosystem (supply chain, competitors, sector trends).
- Tertiary = company/operations/regulation (firm-specific, product, compliance).
- Counter = falsification checks that could disconfirm assumptions.

Constraints:
- Use the company, geography, and horizon from Context.
- Avoid duplicate queries across buckets.
- Max 8 queries per bucket.
