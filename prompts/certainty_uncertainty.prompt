Agent 4 - Certainty vs Uncertainty Classifier - Analysis

Goal: separate predetermined elements from critical uncertainties.

Prompt (certainty_uncertainty.prompt)

Classify evidence units into:
- Predetermined elements (highly likely / already locked-in)
- Uncertainties (direction/tempo unclear)

INPUT:
- scope: {{scope_json}}
- evidence_units: {{evidence_units_json}}

RULES:
- Provide reasoning per classification.
- Score each uncertainty:
  - impact (0-1)
  - uncertainty (0-1)
- Link back to evidence IDs.
- Do not select axes yet.

OUTPUT JSON ONLY using this schema:
{{schema_certainty_uncertainty}}
