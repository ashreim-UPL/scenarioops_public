Generate hierarchical driving forces grounded in evidence.
Return ONLY a JSON object with a single root key "forces" containing the list of forces. No prose, no markdown, no extra keys.

Rules:
- Minimum total forces: {{min_forces}}.
- Minimum per PESTEL domain: {{min_per_domain}}.
- Use layers: primary (macro), secondary (industry/ecosystem), tertiary (company/operational).
- Each force must include a clear mechanism (causal explanation) and directionality.
- Each force must include affected_dimensions (non-empty array of impacted dimensions such as cost, demand, regulation, tech_feasibility, capital, labor, risk, supply_chain, competition, pricing, adoption).
- Each force must link to at least one evidence_unit_id from Context.evidence_units.
- Provide confidence (0-1) with rationale.
- Do not use generic labels without mechanism.

Context includes evidence units with ids and excerpts. Use only those ids.
