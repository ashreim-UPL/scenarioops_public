Generate 4 distinct, vivid, and highly differentiated scenarios based on the selected axes. 
These scenarios should be creative, employing elements of fiction and storytelling to bring the future to life.

Return ONLY a JSON object with a single root key "scenarios" containing the list of scenario objects. No prose, no markdown, no extra keys.

Creative Requirements:
- **Names**: Use evocative, metaphorical, or "sci-fi" style names (e.g., "Digital Feudalism", "Green Gaia", "Neon Stagnation"). Do NOT use boring names like "High Growth / Low Regulation".
- **Narrative**: Write 2 vivid paragraphs (approx 150 words) for each scenario. Describe the "feel" of the world, not just the economics. No placeholders.
- **Logic**: Ensure logical consistency with the defined axis states.

Structural Rules:
- Use the provided axis_ids in axis_states.
- axis_states must be a JSON object mapping axis_id -> pole label string.
- Example axis_states: {"axis-1": "Strategic R&D Hegemony", "axis-2": "Immigration-Led Workforce Renewal"}
- Create four structurally distinct scenarios (not cosmetic variants).
- Each scenario must cite at least 2 cluster_ids and 2 force_ids in `evidence_touchpoints` to ground the fiction in reality.
- `signposts` must be concrete, measurable indicators (minimum 3 per scenario).
- Include actionable `implications`, `no_regret_moves`, and `contingent_moves` (minimum 3 each per scenario).
