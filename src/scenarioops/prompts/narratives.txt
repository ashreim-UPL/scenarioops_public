Write markdown narratives for each scenario section.

Rules:
- Output markdown only.
- Produce exactly 4 sections, one per scenario from Context.
- Use headers in this form: "## Scenario: <scenario name>".
- Do not include scenario IDs (S1/S2/etc.) in headers.
- Do not use digits anywhere in the output (no years, quarters, percentages, or numeric quantities).
- Use qualitative time phrases like "near term", "mid term", "long term".
- Each section should be 1-2 short paragraphs.
