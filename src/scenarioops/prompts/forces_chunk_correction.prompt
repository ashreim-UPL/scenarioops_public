Return ONLY a JSON object that matches the Forces Payload schema. No prose, no markdown, no extra keys.

- Produce up to {{chunk_target_total}} forces.
- Domain maxima: {{domain_targets}} (maximum counts per domain). Do not exceed these caps.
- Every force must have mechanism + directionality + evidence_unit_ids + affected_dimensions.
- Use only evidence_unit_ids provided in Context.
- Remove or fix forces that violate required fields.
