Guidance:
- **story_text**: Write 3-5 paragraphs (250-500 words) of high-quality fiction. Focus on a specific protagonist or scene that illustrates the tension of this world. Use sensory details. Make it feel like a scene from a movie or novel. Avoid dry economic summary or generic filler.
- **visual_prompt**: A highly detailed, cinematic description of a key scene suitable for a high-end image generator. Make it look like professional consulting photography: realistic, clean lighting, neutral palette, no text overlays.
- **Consistency**: Ensure the fiction is strictly grounded in the economic/political logic provided in the scenario context.
