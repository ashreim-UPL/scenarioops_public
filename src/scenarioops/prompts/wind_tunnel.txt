Stress-test strategies across scenarios.
Return ONLY a JSON object that matches the Wind Tunnel schema. No prose, no markdown, no extra keys.

Rules:
- Provide tests for every strategy x scenario pair.
- Include failure_modes, adaptations, feasibility_score, rubric_score, and action.
- Include rubric_inputs for each test with keys: relevance, credibility, recency, specificity (0-1 each).
- If action is KEEP, feasibility_score must be >= 0.60.
- Omit the matrix field (it will be computed downstream).
- Include break_conditions and triggers at the top level, keep them short.
