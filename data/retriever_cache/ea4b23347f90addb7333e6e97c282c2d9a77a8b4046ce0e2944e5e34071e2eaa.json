Featured Content Do you have a side hustle alongside your PhD studies? Take Nature \u2019s poll More than half of Gen Z now have a side gig. Are researchers among those seeking a second income? News 14 Jan 2026 Cancer might evade immune defences by stealing mitochondria Hijacking the energy-producing organelles from immune cells seems to help tumours in mice to infiltrate lymph nodes. Laura Dattaro News 14 Jan 2026 Little red dots as young supermassive black holes in dense ionized cocoons The highest-quality JWST spectra\u00a0reveal that little red dots are young supermassive black holes shrouded in dense cocoons of ionized gas, where electron scattering, not Doppler motions, broadens their spectral lines. V. Rusakov D. Watson J. Witstok Article Open Access 14 Jan 2026 Daily briefing: Same-sex sex is a normal part of some primates\u2019 lives Same-sex sexual behaviour could help some primates cope with complex social hierarchies. Plus, new clues as to where birds came from and the US Environmental Protection Agency will stop including human health in cost\u2013benefit analyses.

Veda C. Storey News & Views 14 Jan 2026 LLMs behaving badly: mistrained AI models quickly go off the rails Training large language models to write insecure code can cause them to exhibit seemingly aggressive behaviour when performing unrelated tasks. Richard Ngo News & Views 14 Jan 2026 Predicting the fate of tropical forests under intensifying heat Intense droughts have caused water stress and elevated mortality for trees in the Amazon, foreshadowing the future of tropical forests as the climate changes. Kristina J. Anderson-Teixeira Krishna Anujan News & Views 14 Jan 2026 Stretchy organic LED devices with an \u2018exciplex\u2019 state are highly efficient Fully stretchable organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been limited by poor efficiency, in part because their elastic-polymer components hinder the harvesting of \u2018triplet-state\u2019 quasiparticles that can be converted into light-emitting states. Fully stretchable OLEDs with unprecedented efficiencies have been developed that recycle triplets in an elastomer-tolerant manner. Research Briefing 14 Jan 2026 Mysterious \u2018little red dots\u2019 could be black holes in disguise Analysis indicates that the light from \u2018little red dots\u2019 is generated by young supermassive black holes obscured by dense clouds of gas.

Shuchen Zhang Yuan Lu Letian Dou Article 14 Jan 2026 Dominant contribution of Asgard archaea to eukaryogenesis A survey of the reconstructed gene set of the last eukaryotic common ancestor shows a consistent link between Asgard archaea and the origin of numerous, functionally diverse\u00a0eukaryotic genes, demonstrating the dominant Asgard contribution to eukaryogenesis. Victor Tobiasson Jacob Luo Eugene V. Koonin Article Open Access 14 Jan 2026 Microbiota-induced T cell plasticity enables immune-mediated tumour control Molecular mimicry between a gut commensal and a tumour antigen forms part of an important mechanistic framework that can boost the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy and restrain tumour growth. Tariq A. Najar Yuan Hao Dan R. Littman Article Open Access 14 Jan 2026 Exciplex-enabled high-efficiency, fully stretchable OLEDs Fabrication of fully stretchable organic light-emitting diodes incorporating an intrinsically stretchable exciplex-assisted phosphorescent layer along with MXene-contact stretchable electrodes is described, demonstrating high efficiency and mechanical compliance for applications in next-generation wearable and deformable displays.
